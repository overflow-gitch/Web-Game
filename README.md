A game made with html canvas

Object of game: you are a small bubble at the bottom of the screen. Get to the top without touching any of the other bubbles.

Enemy behaviour: Each game starts with lots of big bubbles that change color and become smaller as they bump into things. As they become smaller, they become faster, after becoming a certain size, they dissapear.

General game flow: The player is expected to get to the end without touching any of the enemy bubbles. If the enemies are in contact with the player, the player loses a life. The player is either expected to move around the bubbles, or wait for them to dissapear.

Controls: The player bubble will move with arrow controls.

Notes: I expect to be using lots of code from the previous assignment.
